 ## Resume
 
 ###      Technician by ETEC (Technical School of Centro Paula e Souza) Bento Quirino in 2022. Attending the second semester at FATEC Campinas (Faculty of Technology of S√£o Paulo).
 
 ###      I started in Programming when I was 17 years old, still in high school. I was never in the technology area, but since I found it, I fell in love. I like to say that it was "Passion at first code". And since then, I've been getting better and training.
 
 ###      I'm in love with the Front-End, however, I really like the Back-End. At a certain time, I considered going into the area of Cybersecurity or Data Science, I had a soft spot for Python in that sense. But Javascript won my heart along with the front end together.
 
 ###      Today, I am an intern at IBM in Hortolandia. And I work with ServiceNow. I love Technology, and I would love to develop myself further, I know I'm capable of it. With this, I realize my dream of being a great developer in the future.
