 ## My History 
 
 ###      I started in the programming world in the third year of high school, when I passed the entrance exam for ETEC Bento Quirino in the Systems Development Course. It was a challenging and complex experience, because just like high school, it was a remote teaching, so throughout the course, I had a certain difficulty in learning and at certain times (different in real kk) I thought about giving up. <br>
 
 ###      However, I had a lot of support from my family, who did not let me give up. When I finished high school at the end of last year, 2021, I decided to take the Fatec Campinas Vestibular, in the Systems Analysis and Development course. In 2022, I had to make one of the most difficult choices, which would be my turning point, in my opinion. Whether or not to lock T√©cnico to focus on College and enter the job market.
 
 ###      After a lot of conversation, support from friends, family and ex-teachers, I decided to do both together, I confess that it was difficult, but not impossible, so I ran after it, money from the driver's license was in this process, but I know that in the future I save much more. Today, I am a Systems Technician and Development, finishing the first semester of college and looking for my first opportunity in the job market!
